## TensorFlow

### What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for Machine Learning. TensorFlow help you to develop and train Machine Learning models. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research.

TensorFlow provides stable Python and C++ APIs, as well as non-guaranteed backward compatible API for other languages.


### How TensorFlow works?

TensorFlow allows developers to create dataflow graphs—structures that describe how data moves through a graph, or a series of processing nodes. Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation, and each connection or edge between nodes is a multidimensional data array, or tensor.

### Tensorflow Models 

There are official models collection of Tensorflow that use TensorFlow's high-level API. 

For Image Classification, the models are MNIST, ResNet, and EfficientNet. For Object Detection and Segmentation, the models are RetinaNet, Mask R-CNN, ShapeMask, SpineNet.

For Natural Language Processing, the models are ALBERT (A Lite BERT), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), NHNet (News Headline generation model), Transformer, and XLNet. For Recommender, the models are NCF.


### TensorFlow Application

There are many Application and Product that using TensorFlow for the development of their apps. 
- RankBrain is a large-scale deployment of deep neural nets for search ranking on www.google.com. It is a part of the search algorithm that’s used to sort through the billions of pages it knows about and finds the ones deemed most relevant.
- Inception Image Classifier, developed by Google, is a baseline model and follow-on research into highly accurate computer vision models
- Google Creative Labs Teachable Machine which uses TensorFlow.js which lets you teach using your computer camera, live in the browser.
- And so many things!
